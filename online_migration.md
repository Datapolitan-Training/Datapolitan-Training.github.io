# Migrating training from live in-person to online self-paced

## Summary
Datapolitan specializes in [instructor-led, in-person training with government employees](http://training.datapolitan.com). As such, we are able to shape a learning experience that meets the varying needs of the students we encounter. In keeping with our commitment to openness and transparency, we've made our materials available online. While this is good for those seeking to develop their own training experience in data analytics with government open data, these materials don't lend themselves to being used exclusively online. In order to address these concerns, we've developed this short guide for taking our training materials and developing online, self-paced content. This is based on our experience developing training in both contexts and look forward to any suggestions you have for improving the content you find here. Feel free to make your own changes by [forking the repository and creating a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) or [opening an issue](https://github.com/Datapolitan-Training/Datapolitan-Training.github.io/issues) with your suggested changes. 

## Things to remember about live, facilitated training
+ The training experience is more responsive to varying background, experiences, talents, and abilities of students
+ The instructor can adjust content to accommodate the varying needs of the students
+ Missing detail from presentation materials can be filled in by the instructor
+ Clarification can be provided contextually to students based on cues such as body language, facial expression, and other indicators of understanding (or lack of understanding)
+ Instructor can vary the pacing and tone of content to meet students needs
+ Instruction can procede along a logical flow from one topic to another knowing what students have already understood from previous topics
+ Students are focused on material from beginning to end and need less reinforcement of key concepts

## Things to remember about online, self-paced training
+ The training materials are inflexible and under control of the student rather than the instructor
+ To the extent possible, each variable in student background, experience, talent, ability, and overall perspective must be taken into account in advance
+ Material should be tested with students who represent a broad cross-section of the anticipated audience to ensure the materials provide adequate clarity and consistency across the varying levels of student interest, experience, and understanding
+ Students will likely start and stop the training at various points in the learning experience and will likely need to be reminded of key learning points (i.e. can't rely on a "one and done" model of instruction)
+ Consistent student feedback collection is essential to ensuring content stays interesting, relevant, and accessible

## Suggested migration path
1. Map student journey through the material from their anticipated starting point to the desired end point
2. Identify key learning milestones in the journey
3. Remove contextual content that doesn't fit into the online training (group discussions, partnered projects, etc)
4. Draft [explanatory text and notes](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Markdown#slide-notes) to [accompany slides](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Presentation-mode), with an emphasis on explicitly reinforcing key concepts throughout the materials
5. Test the slides, explanatory text, and other materials with a cross-section of potential students to identify key information gaps, learning discontinuities, and other issues
6. Refine the slides, explanatory text, and other materials for clarity, consistency, and completeness based on feedback
7. Develop a short but useful survey instrument to collect student feedback on key learning objectives, content, and style
8. Launch online materials with regular review of student feedback for continuous improvement and ongoing development
